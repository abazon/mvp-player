Written in Open Laszlo.

# Intro #
This player has been developed with the goal of including it in MPV packages so as to have the capability to play package content from the local file system (still needs to be served by a web server) or being able to have package run as a SCORM object delivered through an LMS.

# Notes #
The player currently runs with Openlaszlo v4.4.0 compiled under the swf8 runtime. The player supports v0.50 of the MVP schema.

The most notable lack of support of later version is the new Media element in the XHTML. It also does not support more than 1 level depth of NodeSection in the Activity Model
